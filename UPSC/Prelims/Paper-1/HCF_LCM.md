To find the smallest number that, when divided by 15, 25, and 30, leaves a remainder of 5 in each case, follow these steps:
**Solution**
### Step 1: Convert the problem to standard form

The problem states that the number leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 15, 25, and 30. This means the number is **5 more than a multiple** of these numbers. If we subtract 5 from the desired number, it will be divisible by 15, 25, and 30.

Let the number be \( N \). We can rewrite the condition as:
\[
N - 5 \text{ is divisible by 15, 25, and 30.}
\]
So, \( N - 5 \) must be the **LCM** of 15, 25, and 30.

### Step 2: Find the LCM of 15, 25, and 30

First, do the prime factorization of each number:
- \( 15 = 3 \times 5 \)
- \( 25 = 5^2 \)
- \( 30 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \)

Now, take the highest powers of each prime factor:
- Highest power of 2: \( 2^1 \)
- Highest power of 3: \( 3^1 \)
- Highest power of 5: \( 5^2 \)

So, the LCM is:
\[
\text{LCM} = 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 5^2 = 2 \times 3 \times 25 = 150
\]

### Step 3: Add 5 back to the LCM

Now, \( N - 5 = 150 \), so:
\[
N = 150 + 5 = 155
\]

### Step 4: Conclusion

The smallest number that, when divided by 15, 25, and 30, leaves a remainder of 5 in each case is **155**.
